# GHA_DLC_Patch
 Patch to enable GHA DLC Scanning

Instructions for the patch:
- Back up the compress.toc files in `DATA\COMPRESSED` (just in case) from the disc-install on your 360/PS3 (The PS3 files are in another subfolder called `PS3`)
- Merge the DATA folder on-disc with the DATA folder in this zip.
